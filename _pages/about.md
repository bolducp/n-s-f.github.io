I'm currently a student in the Johns Hopkins [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/). Before that I was a research engineering fellow at [Fast Forward Labs](http://fastforwardlabs.com), a senior software developer at [Avaaz](http://avaaz.org), and a developer at [Softwire](http://softwire.co.uk).
